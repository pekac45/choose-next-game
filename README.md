### Hello, world!

Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:

- [ASP.NET Core](https://get.asp.net/) and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) for cross-platform server-side code
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for client-side code
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and styling

To help you get started, we have also set up:

- **Client-side navigation**. For example, click _Counter_ then _Back_ to return here.
- **Development server integration**. In development mode, the development server from `create-react-app` runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.
- **Efficient production builds**. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your `dotnet publish` configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled JavaScript files.

The `ClientApp` subdirectory is a standard React application based on the `create-react-app` template. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run `npm` commands such as `npm test` or `npm install`.
